# Communicate Data Finding
Ford GoBike System Data

## by Rinad Bankher


## Dataset

Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system located in San Francisco Bay Area. This dataset shows history data of individual rides made in a bike-sharing system at 2019. 

The cleaned dataset has 171617 rows and 2 columns with 3 additional columns by feature engineering (member_age, hours, and weekdays).


1. `user_type`: user type either Subscriber or Customer 
2. `member_gender`: member gender
3. `member_age`: age of user
4. `hours`: time of ride
5. `weekdays`: day of ride


## Summary of Findings

#### Univariate Exploration

    - Most GoBike users age between 28-33 years old.
    - Majority of users gender are male.
    - Majority of user type is a subscriber.
    - Number of bike rides on weekdays are higher than on weekends.
    - Number of bike rides at peaks between 8–9 AM and 5–6 PM.

#### Bivariate Exploration

    - Females in nearly 30s tend to ride bikes than all different genders.
    - The other gender has more users at age 50s.
    - Most users were Male for each user type.
    - The Majority of users fall between 28 to 33 years old for both user types.
    - Weekdays have high number of rides for both user types.
    - Customers user type ride bikes often between 5-6 PM, while subscribers ride bikes during rush hours
    (8-9 AM and 5-6 PM).

#### Multivariate Exploration

    The multivariate exploring section did support and prove the founding in the bivariate section. I 
    also notice customers are more likely to ride bikes on weekends, which consider a chance for the 
    company to increase its customer users. I found this point is interesting as I think customer users 
    ride the bike other than for work, unlike subscribe users.


## Key Insights for Presentation

    - The majority of bike users are male regardless of users type.
    - Most users age between 28-33.
    - The majority of users type are subscribers. The subscribers ride a bike mainly because of their 
      job, so most demand happens during rush hour on weekdays. 
    - Unlike subscribers, customers ride the bike other than work. Customers are more likely to ride
      bikes on weekends as a holiday activity, which is a chance for the company to attract more 
      customers by discounts or gifts.
